# algorithms
Implemented algorithms in c++

1.BBSimplexMethod:
  Dual Simplex Method for solving linear systems (in this case use the simplexmethod(working version).cpp file)
  Branch and Bound Method for solving integer systtems (default)
  Note that external library <a href="http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page">Eigen</a> is required for this algorithm
